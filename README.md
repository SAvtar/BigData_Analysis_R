# BigData_Analysis_R
The data of two years, i.e., 2007 and 2008 is analyzed

The analysis of two years data of 2007 and 2008 of airlines and airports is done 
using R language in the R-Studio environment.

R-Studio is the awesome framework to work in, for all groups of developers.

The R files are basically the assignments of a University; starting from very basic fundas:
Like understanding Matrices, Vectors, Operations on both;
then the rocket shoots for strengthening the concepts of Probability and Statistics.
and finally applying all the learnings to Big Data Analysis
